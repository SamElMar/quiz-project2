# Project Brief:
The scope of this project was to design a web application. It was required that the project be carefully plannede, with the use of a Trello or Kanban board. The app needs to have a minimum of two relational databases to store data and have the data from one table interact with the other. This application needed to incorperate CRUD functionality, which allows for date to be created, read, updated and deleted. Additionally extensive testing is required in order to validate the application. The application is also required to have a functioing front-end website

# App Design:
The appication which I chose to create was that of a quiz app. Through the app the user is able to:

Create their own questions, options and answers.

Read the questions which have been created and answer them by selecting one of the four options provided. Additionally they are able to read how many questions are present within the database.

Update the questions by choosing to change the question, answer and/or the various options.

Delete the questions from within the database.


The databases used for the application were first designed using ERD diagrams as seen below.
